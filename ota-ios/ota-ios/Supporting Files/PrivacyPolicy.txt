What information we collect from you

In General. We receive and store any information you enter on our mobile application or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and email addresses, fax number, and billing information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date). We may also request information about your hotel room preferences, and frequent flyer and car rental program information. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to book travel; participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes; ask us a question; or initiate other transactions on our mobile application.

Travel Companion Information. When you make a reservation for someone else through this mobile application, we may request personal information and travel preferences about that individual. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing us with their personal information and travel preferences, as any access to view or change their information will be available only through your account.

Information from Other Sources. We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and demographic information.

Automatic Information. We automatically collect some information about your device when you visit this mobile application. For example, we will collect your IP address, Web browser software (such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer), and referring mobile application. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as trips viewed and bookings made. Our goals in collecting this automatic information include helping customize your user experience and inhibiting fraud. For more information, please see Cookies and other technologies.

How we use your information

We use sensitive billing information (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) for the purpose of completing the travel bookings you conduct on our mobile application. We use other information about you for the following general purposes: to provide you with the products and services you request; to provide you with travel confirmation and updates; to manage your booking, including processing bills and providing travel notifications; to communicate with you in general; to respond to your questions and comments; to measure interest in and improve our products, services, and mobile application; to notify you about special offers and products or services that may be of interest to you; to otherwise customize your experience with this mobile application; to reward you as part of any reward and recognition program you choose to join; to solicit information from you, including through surveys; to resolve disputes, collect fees, or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.

Email Communications. We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on this mobile application. One way we do this is by sending you email messages that contain information about your apparent travel-related interests. We believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our mobile application. Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these special offer email messages in any such email we send.

Please review Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information below.

With whom we share your information

This mobile application may share your information with the following entities:

Suppliers, such as hotel, airline, car rental, and activity providers, who fulfill yourtravel reservations. Throughout this mobile application, all services provided by a third-party supplier are described as such. We do not share your email address with these suppliers unless they need it to fulfill the travel reservation you have made through this mobile application, and we restrict their use of this information to that purpose. We do not place limitations on our suppliers' use or disclosure of your other personal information. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any travel supplier whose products you book through this mobile application. Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you, facilitate your travel reservation, or respond to a review you may submit.
Third-party vendors who provide services or functions on our behalf, including credit card processing, business analytics, customer service, marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention. We may also authorize third-party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including as necessary to operate features of our mobile application or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests. Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose. They are also required to follow the same data security practices that we ourselves adhere to.
Business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services may be offered on our mobile application. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear, either alone or with ours. If you choose to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners.
Affiliates and other referring mobile applications. An Affiliate is a mobile application not owned or operated by IAN, but which uses IAN's booking capabilities for processing travel reservations. The IAN name may or may not appear on the Affiliate mobile application. You may have accessed IAN via one of our Affiliate mobile applications. If you were referred to this mobile application from an Affiliate or another mobile application (for example, through a link you clicked on another mobile application that directed you to this one), we may share some information about you with that referring mobile application. We have not placed limitations on the Affiliate or other referring mobile applications' use of your personal information and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any mobile application that referred you here.
Companies within our corporate family. We may share your personal information with our parent company and corporate affiliates, including Hotwire, TripAdvisor, Expedia and hotels.com. This sharing enables us to provide you with information about products and services, both travel-related and other, which might interest you. To the extent that our parent company and corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy. They also will comply with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any commercial email they send to choose not to receive such email messages in the future.
We also may share your information:

In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company or this mobile application, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Use and other agreements.
In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information.

We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of users our mobile application receives or the most popular hotels and vacation destinations. This information does not contain any personal information and is used todevelop content and services we hope you will find of interest.

Your choices with respect to collection and use of your information

As discussed above, you can choose not to provide us with any information, although it may be needed to book travel or to take advantage of certain features offered on this mobile application.
You may be given the opportunity to subscribe to an email newsletter to receive information about special offers. If you choose to do so, you will also be given the opportunity to unsubscribe from commercial messages in any such email we send. Please note that we reserve the right to send you other communications, including service announcements, administrative messages, and surveys relating to your transactions on this mobile application, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
You may have the opportunity on our mobile application to provide a mobile number in order to receive day-of-travel flight alerts. You may discontinue these alerts at any time.
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies from this mobile application, you will not be able to access portions of our mobile application.
Cookies and other technologies

Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your device's hard drive (if your Web browser permits). This mobile application uses cookies for the following general purposes:

To help us recognize your browser as a previous user and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was using our mobile application. For example, if you register on our mobile application, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our mobile application each time you visit. We also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled "Sign me in automatically next time." Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes. Unless you register with us, these cookies will not contain any personal information.
To help us customize the content and advertisements provided to you on this mobile application and on other mobile applications across the Internet. For example, when you access a page on our mobile application, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests. See Display of Advertising/Your Choices for more information about our online advertising practices and your choices.
To help measure and research the effectiveness of mobile application features and offerings, advertisements, and email communications (by determining which emails you open and act upon).
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered on our mobile applications.

In addition to the above cookies, we use Local Shared Objects, also referred to as "flash cookies," on our web mobile application. These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content on our mobile application. Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text. By themselves, they cannot do anything to or with the data on your device. Like other cookies, they can only access personally identifiable information that you have provided on this mobile application, and cannot be accessed by other mobile applications. To find out more about flash cookies or how to disable them, please click here: http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html.

This mobile application may also use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our mobile applications to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our mobile application from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party mobile application, and to improve mobile application performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the user traffic and actions on our mobile application. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.

Display of tailored advertising/Your choices

Data collected by this mobile application to serve you with relevant advertising. IAN is committed to providing you with relevant content and information. To do this, we may, through cookies and other technologies, collect information about your travel-related searches, such as whether you are looking for airline flights or hotels. We use this information, together with other information we have collected about you, to serve you with ads, on our mobile application or elsewhere online, that match your apparent interests. So, for example, if you search for a hotel in Florida on this mobile application, you may see an ad for a Florida travel package on this mobile application or on another mobile application you visit.

Please note that we do not combine the information we collect about your travel-related searches on this mobile application with personal information (such as email address) to serve you with ads across other mobile applications. We also do not share your personal information with third parties so they can serve you with advertisements. You can choose not to receive tailored online advertising on other mobile applications, based on your travel-related searches on this mobile application, by clicking here. Note that if you choose not to receive tailored ads, you will still see online advertisements, but they will be more general and less relevant to you.

Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising. The advertisements you see on this mobile application are served by us or by our service providers. But we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies. These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our mobile applications; and (2) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different mobile applications on the Internet. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our mobile applications and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests. We do not permit these third parties to collect personal information about you (such as email address) on our mobile application, nor do we share with them any personal information about you.

Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. To learn more, please click here.

Data collected by companies that operate cookie-based exchanges to serve you with relevant advertising. Like other companies operating online, IAN participates in cookie-based exchanges where anonymous information is collected about your browsing behavior through cookies and other technologies and segmented into different topics of interest (such as travel). These topics of interest are then shared with third parties, including advertisers and ad networks, so they can tailor advertisements to your apparent interests. We do not share personal information (such as your email address) with these companies and we do not permit these companies to collect any such information about you on our mobile application. Please click here to learn more about cookie-based exchanges, including how to access information about the topics of interest associated with cookies on your device and how to decline participation in these programs.

How we protect your information

We want you to feel confident about using this mobile application to make travel arrangements, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect. While no mobile application can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may only do so for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.
